During the inaugural [Los Angeles School of Data](https://schoolofdata.la) hosted by [Data + Donuts LA](https://datadonuts.la) I co-taught a ninety-minute introductory workshop on spatial data in R and QGIS with [Andy Rutkowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-rutkowski-7906b15b), the visualization specialist with the University of Southern California libraries.  The workshop, and School of Data as a whole, was geared toward Los Angeles civic employees with the goal of promoting data literacy and analysis skills.
