During the 2021 [Los Angeles Geospatial Summit](https://spatial.usc.edu/los-angeles-geospatial-summit-events) I gave a lightening talk with my co-author Emily Serman.  Our talk focused on our recent work, carried out with [Dr. Jennifer Ailshire](https://gero.usc.edu/faculty/ailshire) of the University of Southern California, on the combined threat of both increasing heat days and increasing older population in the United States.  As older populations tend to have a higher risk of adverse health impacts due to heat but also have a different spatial distribution compared to the general population, it is essential to characterize the risk of future extreme heat to this population.  In addition, older populations in the United States tend to be clustered in regions associated with high heat and increasing heat.
