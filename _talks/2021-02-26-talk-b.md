During the 2021 [Los Angeles Geospatial Summit](https://spatial.usc.edu/los-angeles-geospatial-summit-events) I also presented a poster on my ongoing work exploring the impact of multiple sources of potential lead contamination on soil lead in a complex urban residential area.  This work comprised the first component of my doctoral dissertation research and was carried out under the guidance of my dissertation co-advisors [Jill Johnston](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jill-johnston-9b32a354) and [Dr. An-Min Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anminwu) of the University of Southern California.
