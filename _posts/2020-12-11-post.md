I am excited to share that I will be presenting two of my current research projects at the upcoming [Los Angeles Geospatial Summit](https://spatial.usc.edu/los-angeles-geospatial-summit-events/2021-program-at-a-glance) on Friday, February 26, 2021.  I will be giving a paper presentation of my work on extreme heat and aging populations in the United States with my co-author Emily Serman as well as presenting a post of my work on the drivers of soil lead contamination levels in an urban setting.  I’m very much looking forward to the opportunity to share and receive feedback on these two projects!
