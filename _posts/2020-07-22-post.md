I'm very excited to report that [the New York Times has published an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/climate/gas-flares-premature-babies.html) detailing the findings of some of my recent work exploring the impacts of gas emitted from fracking flares on adverse birth outcomes in rural women.  The original article, [Flaring from Unconventional Oil and Gas Development and Birth Outcomes in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP6394) was published earlier this month in Environmental Health Perspectives with my amazing co-authors [Dr. Lara Cushing]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/lara-cushing) of the University of California Los Angeles and [Ken Chau]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-chau-05b35323), [Dr. Meredith Franklin]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/meredithfranklin), and [Dr. Jill Johnston]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/jill-johnston-9b32a354) of the University of Southern California.
