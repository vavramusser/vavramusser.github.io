I am excited to share that I will be presenting two of my current research projects at the upcoming [Los Angeles Geospatial Summit](https://spatial.usc.edu/los-angeles-geospatial-summit-events/2021-program-at-a-glance) on Friday, February 26, 2021.  I will be giving a paper presentation of my work on extreme heat and aging populations in the United States with my co-author Emily Serman as well as presenting a post of my work on the drivers of soil lead contamination levels in an urban setting.  Iâ€™m very much looking forward to the opportunity to share and receive feedback on these two projects!
