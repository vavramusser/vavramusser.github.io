Today I am overjoyed and honored to share that I am one of only 6% of applicants selected to be a part of the inaugural cohort of [Correlation Oneâ€™s](https://www.correlation-one.com) new [Data Science for All (DS4A) Empowerment](https://www.correlation-one.com/ds4a-empowerment) program.  This 13-week data science program is specifically designed to empower and support underrepresented groups in technology fields gain data science skills, project development experience, build their network, and create and support an inclusive community.

Not only am I excited for the opportunity to push my data science skills to the next level, but I am so glad just to be a part of a program rooted in promoting diversity, inclusion, and representation in science and technology.

My first session is coming up on Saturday, October 24, 2020!
