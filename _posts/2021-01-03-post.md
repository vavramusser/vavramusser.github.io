Thank you so much to [Serenze Global](https://serenzeglobal.org) and [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com) for selecting me as one of the recipients of the [2021 Technology Education Grant](https://serenzeglobal.org/2021-technology-education-grant-application)!  The grant incudes a year of free access to Pluralsightâ€™s catalog of technology and data science courses as well as support, mentorship, and to the 2021 cohort community through Serenze Global.  Serenze Global is an amazing organization whose mission is to promote diversity in the tech industry by providing free STEM education and support to under-represented groups within the tech industry.  I am so excited to be a part of this community and to continue my data science and analysis skill development.
