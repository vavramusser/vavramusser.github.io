Thank you so much to [LA Tech4Good](https://www.latech4good.org) for selecting me as one of the scholarship recepients for the upcoming [Equity + Ethics in Data Workshop](https://www.latech4good.org/dataworkshop).  LA Tech4Good is an amazing organization focused on promoting and supporting technology initiatives that promote social good in the Los Angeles area.  I'm so looking forward to joining this workshop next week!
