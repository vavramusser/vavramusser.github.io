Today I am so excited to report that I have been accepted as a member of the [Coding it Forward Civic Digital Fellowship](https://www.codingitforward.com/civic-digital-fellowship) for the 2021 summer.  The Coding it Forward Civic Digital Fellowship is a 10-week sumemr fellowship and each fellow is paired with a United States government with the goal of applying their technical skills to develop solutions that will serve everyday Americans.  I am very excited to have been paired with the US Census Bureau on an amazing project working to restructure ambulatory health surveys using machine learning methods.
