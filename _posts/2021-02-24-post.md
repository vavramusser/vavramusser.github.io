I'm so thankful to the [University Consortium for GIS (UCGIS)](https://www.ucgis.org) for deciding to promote me to the [UCGIS Executive Board](https://www.ucgis.org/leadership) as the Communications Co-Chair.  Special thanks to [Jennifer Bernstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-bernstein-49a0a2176), the other Co-Chair and my partner on the Communications Committee for recommending me for this promotion and for [Diana Sinton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diana-sinton-6a261b17) the UCGIS Executive Director for her continued support of my involvement with UCGIS.  I have been actively working on the UCGIS Communications Committee since December 2019 working to expand the UCGIS online presence and social media accounts.  I am so excited for what we have already accomplished: the [UCGIS Twitter account](https://twitter.com/UCGIScience) has expanded from 300 to 900 followers, we have launched a [UCGIS LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ucgis), and we are also working on a new Slack community coming soon.  Iâ€™m very excited for this new role and my continued work with the UCGIS Communications Committee!
