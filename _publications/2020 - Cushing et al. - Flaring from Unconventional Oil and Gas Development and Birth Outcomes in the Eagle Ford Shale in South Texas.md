excerpt: 'Exposure to a high number of nightly flare events was associated with a 50% higher odds of preterm birth and shorter gestation compared with no exposure. Effect estimates were slightly reduced after adjustment for the number of wells within 5km. In stratified models these associations were present only among Hispanic women. Flaring and fetal growth outcomes were not significantly associated. Women exposed to a high number of wells vs. no wells within 5km had a higher odds of preterm birth, shorter gestation, and lower average birthweight.'
