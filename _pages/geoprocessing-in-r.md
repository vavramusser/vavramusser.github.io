Welcome to Intermediate Geoprocessing in R Workshop at the 2021 UCGIS Symposium!

This workshop will be held virtually on June 10 from 6:00 to 7:30 EST as part of the [2021 UCGIS Symposium](https://www.ucgis.org/symposium-2021).  Registration for the 2021 UCGIS Symposium is not yet live.

Course Description
======
This 90-minute course will introduce participants to geoprocessing tools and processes in the R programming language.  Some prior experience with R is expected.  This course will cover spatial data management, basic spatial processes for vector data (including merges, joins, clips, spatial data transformations, calculating buffers and distances, and other processes), raster calculations, and the basics of interpolation methods in R.

Prerequisite Knowledge
======
Participants are expected to have some prior experience with R and RStudio as well as some basic programming skills and understanding of programming principles.  Participants should have prior experience using and manipulating non-spatial data in R but do not need to have prior experience working with spatial data in R.

Workshop Requirements
======
Prior to attending the workshop, please download and install R and RStudio if you do not already have both on your machine.  I will begin the workshop under the assumption that everyone has R and RStudio already installed.  Instructions for installing R and RStudio are given on the site for my [Introduction to R Programming for Spatial Data](https://vavramusser.github.io/intro-to-r-spatial) workshop.  If you have any trouble following these instructions or completing the installation, please [reach out to Kate](mailto:vavramusser@gmail.com).
