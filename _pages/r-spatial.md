## A Guide to Producing Reproducible Social Science Workflows in R

Welcome to the R Spatial Notebook, a collection of interactive code notebooks designed to support researchers, analysts, and data enthusiasts create reproducible spatial workflows in R.  These notebooks introduce users to automated data extraction for multiple key social and environmental data sources (including IPUMS, Natural Earth, OSM, and many others), data cleaning and integration for both tabular and spatial data, foundational and advanced spatial tools and workflows, and mapping tips and techniques - all using R.

The notebook series is designed to be used like a book with earlier chapters providing foundational concepts and workflows necessary to complete later chapters.  However, each notebook is also a standalone resource and designed to be downloaded and modified to support the user's specific research and education needs.

Whether you're new to spatial data science looking for a place to get started or an experience R coder looking to expand your existing workflows, these notebooks are designed to support your journey in understanding and applying spatial methodologies with R.
