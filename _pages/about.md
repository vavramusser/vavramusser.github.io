Welcome to Kate Vavra-Musser's personal website!

About Me
======

I am currently a fourth year PhD candidate in the [Population, Health, and Place doctoral program]( https://spatial.usc.edu/ph-d-in-population) at the University of Southern California (USC).  This unique interdisciplinary program is jointly hosted by the Department of Sociology, Department of Preventative Medicine, and the Spatial Sciences Institute at USC.

My work and personal goals focus on using data-driven methods and spatial perspectives to solve environmental health and environmental justice issues.  I believe that, through research and creative approaches to data and analysis, we can identify and solve our worldâ€™s environmental and social problems and create a better future for everyone.

You can find out more about my past research and background by taking a look at my previous [publications](https://vavramusser.github.io/publications) and my [CV]( https://vavramusser.github.io/cv). The sections below provide additional updates on research and projects I am working on right now.

If you would like to get in touch, I am available via [email](vavramusser@gmail.com) or for [remote meetings]( https://calbird.com/kate-vavramusser/remote).

This summer I will be a member of the [Civic Digital Fellowship](https://www.codingitforward.com/civic-digital-fellowship) program with [Coding it Forward](https://www.codingitforward.com).  I am so excited to report that, through the Civic Digital Fellowship program, I have been paired with the United States Census Bureau to support a series of projects focused on survey redesign and rescoping using machine learning methods.
