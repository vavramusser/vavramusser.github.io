Data Science for All (DS4A) Empowerment 2020-2021 Cohort
------
Since October 2020, I have been a member of the inagural cohort of Correlation One's [Data Science for All (DS4A) Empowerment](https://www.correlation-one.com/ds4a-empowerment) program.  This 13-week data science course is specifically designed to support under-represented groups in science and technology fields to gain data science skills and build their professional network.

I have been deeply honored to be a part of the inagural run of this program which has not only helped me to expand my data science skillset but is also aligned with my personal values of inclusion, equity, diversity, and social justice.

I expect to complete the DS4AE program in February 2021.

**Assessing the Impact of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loans on Local Economies**
As a part of the DS4AE program I have been working on a small group project with my amazing teammates [Emily Flores](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-flores-gaspar), [Mikio Harman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikioharman), [Eugenia Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugenia-miller), and [Victor Olusajo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorolusajo).  The goal of our project is to determine the extent of the impact (or lack of impact) on of PPP loans on the closure status of local businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Watch this space for updates on this project!
