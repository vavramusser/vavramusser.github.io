Welcome to Kate Vavra-Musser's personal website!

About Me
======

*I am currently a fourth year PhD candidate in the [Population, Health, and Place doctoral program]( https://spatial.usc.edu/ph-d-in-population) at the University of Southern California (USC).  This unique interdisciplinary program is jointly hosted by the Department of Sociology, Department of Preventative Medicine, and the Spatial Sciences Institute at USC.*

*My work and personal goals focus on using data-driven methods and spatial perspectives to solve environmental health and environmental justice issues.  I believe that, through research and creative approaches to data and analysis, we can identify and solve our world’s environmental and social problems and create a better future for everyone.*

*You can find out more about my past research and background by taking a look at my previous [publications](https://vavramusser.github.io/publications) and my [CV]( https://vavramusser.github.io/cv).*

*The sections below provide additional updates on research and projects I am working on right now.*

*If you would like to get in touch with me, I am available via [email](vavramusser@gmail.com) or for [remote meetings]( https://calbird.com/kate-vavramusser/remote) over Zoom.*



**Data Science for All (DS4A) Empowerment Inagural 2020-2021 Cohort**
------

Since October 2020 I have been a proud member of the inaugural cohort of [Correlation One’s](https://www.correlation-one.com) [Data Science for All (DS4A) Empowerment](https://www.correlation-one.com/ds4a-empowerment) fellowship program.  DS4AE is a 13-week data science course which is specifically designed to support the inclusion of underrepresented groups in tech.  I am so honored to be included in a program which not only has helped me expand my data science and analysis skillset but is also committed to inclusion, diversity, and equity in the tech field.  I expect to complete the DS4AE program in February 2021.

As part of the DS4AE program, I have been working with my amazing teammates [Emily Flores](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-flores-gaspar), [Mikio Harman]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikioharman), [Eugenia Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugenia-miller), and [Victor Olusajo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorolusajo) on a project assessing the impact of Payroll Protection Program (PPP) loans on the health of local economies during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Watch this space for updates on this project!

Since May 2020 I have been working with [Dr. Jennifer Ailshire](https://gero.usc.edu/faculty/ailshire) from the USC School of Gerontology on multiple projects exploring the environmental and community drivers of health in older populations.
